  Grafana dashboards fetched from open source projects and prepared to be imported with grafana dashboard provisioner.

introduction: |-
  Starting with [Grafana 5.0](http://docs.grafana.org/administration/provisioning/#dashboards) there is a provisioning
  system that uses config files to create\update dashboards.

  [The problem](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/issues/10786) with the provisioner is that it does not support
  dashboards variables.

  This project is a workaround for the problem.
  It fetches dashboard files and processes them replacing `${DS_PROMETHEUS}` with `Prometheus`, and then saves it.

  Processed dashboards files are committed into the repo, so you can provision them by putting the files into grafana
  provisioner dashboards directory. __Requires existing Prometheus datasource named `Prometheus`__

  Currently supported dashboards:
  * [kube-prometheus](https://github.com/coreos/prometheus-operator/master/helm/grafana/dashboards/)
  * [nginx-ingress](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/master/deploy/grafana/dashboards/)

include:
  - "docs/targets.md"
