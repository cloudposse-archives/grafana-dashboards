---

This project is part of our comprehensive ["SweetOps"](https://docs.cloudposse.com) approach towards DevOps. 


It's 100% Open Source and licensed under the [APACHE2](LICENSE).









## Introduction

Starting from [Grafana 5.0](http://docs.grafana.org/administration/provisioning/#dashboards) there is provisioning
system that uses config files to create\update dashboards.

[The problem](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/issues/10786) with the provisioner is that it does not support
dashboards variables.

This project is about workaround for the problem.
It fetch dashboard files and process them replacing `${DS_PROMETHEUS}` with `Prometheus` value and save it.

Processed dashboards files are commited into the repo, so you can provision them by putting the files into grafana
provisioner dashboards directory. __Required existed prometheus datasource named `Prometheus`__

Current supported dashboards:
* [kube-prometheus](https://github.com/coreos/prometheus-operator/master/helm/grafana/dashboards/)
* [nginx-ingress](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/master/deploy/grafana/dashboards/)
