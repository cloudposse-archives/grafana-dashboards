Grafana dashboards fetched from open source projects and prepared to be imported with grafana dashboard provisioner.

This project is part of our comprehensive ["SweetOps"](https://docs.cloudposse.com) approach towards DevOps. 


It's 100% Open Source and licensed under the [APACHE2](LICENSE).









## Introduction

Starting with [Grafana 5.0](http://docs.grafana.org/administration/provisioning/#dashboards) there is a provisioning
system that uses config files to create\update dashboards.

[The problem](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/issues/10786) with the provisioner is that it does not support
dashboards variables.

This project is a workaround for the problem.
It fetches dashboard files and processes them replacing `${DS_PROMETHEUS}` with `Prometheus`, and then saves it.

Processed dashboards files are committed into the repo, so you can provision them by putting the files into grafana
provisioner dashboards directory. __Requires existing Prometheus datasource named `Prometheus`__

Currently supported dashboards:
* [kube-prometheus](https://github.com/coreos/prometheus-operator/master/helm/grafana/dashboards/)
* [nginx-ingress](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/master/deploy/grafana/dashboards/)
